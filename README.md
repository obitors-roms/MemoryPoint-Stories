## Usage


You can find complete working example here https://github.com/awaik/flutter_instagram_stories/tree/master/example

*Dart code*

Connect to collection where you keep stories

```dart
    static String collectionDbName = 'instagram_stories_db';
    CollectionReference dbInstance =
      Firestore.instance.collection(collectionDbName);
```

And add stories full functionality to your app.

```dart
    FlutterInstagramStories(
        collectionDbName: collectionDbName,
        showTitleOnIcon: true,
        backFromStories: () {
          _backFromStoriesAlert();
        },
        iconTextStyle: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 14.0,
          color: Colors.white,
        ),
        iconImageBorderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15.0),
        iconBoxDecoration: BoxDecoration(
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(15.0)),
          color: Color(0xFFffffff),
          boxShadow: [
            BoxShadow(
              color: Color(0xff333333),
              blurRadius: 10.0,
              offset: Offset(
                0.0,
                4.0,
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
        iconWidth: 150.0,
        iconHeight: 150.0,
        textInIconPadding:
            EdgeInsets.only(left: 8.0, right: 8.0, bottom: 12.0),
        //how long story lasts in seconds
        imageStoryDuration: 7,
        progressPosition: ProgressPosition.top,
        repeat: true,
        inline: false,
        languageCode: 'en',
        closeButtonIcon: Icon(
          Icons.close,
          color: Colors.blueGrey,
          size: 28.0,
        ),
        closeButtonBackgroundColor: Color(0x00ffffff),
      ),
```

*Firestore database*

Plugin works with Firestore database and package https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore already included into plugin.

You can use [example](https://github.com/awaik/flutter_instagram_stories/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart) with sample database in example folder or create your own database.

Steps to create:

1. Add Firebase to your app

- Android https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android
- iOS https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios

2. Create Firestore database

- Create collection with any name. After you will use this name in dart code only once.
- Create documents inside collection with exact structure, like on image below


```
    DateTime date;
    List file
       // for example
       // [{String filetype, String url}
       //  {String filetype, String url}
       //  ...]
    String previewImage;
    Map previewTitle
       // for example
       // {"en": someText, "anyLangCode": someText}
```
